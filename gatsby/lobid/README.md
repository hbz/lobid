<h2> Static and generated sites </h2>

Some sites are just static plain html. These must reside in the `static` folder. They will be deployed to the proper place when doing `npm run build` or `npm run develop`.
Some other pages, like lobid's `team` page, are generated using gatsby. The [team.json](https://github.com/hbz/lobid/tree/master/gatsby/lobid/static/team.json) is used as the _model_, the two files [team-de.js and team-en.js](https:/github.com/hbz/lobid/tree/master/gatsby/lobid/src/pages/) work as the _controller_ (basically using _graphql_ to get the data from the _team.json_ ) which use the
[team.html.js](https:/github.com/hbz/lobid/tree/master/gatsby/lobid/src/components/team.html.js) to generate views.

## Prerequisites

[Install the lastest nvm version](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

We use node 18, you can install and enable it with:

```shell
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

1. **Start developing**
   
   After cloning the repo:
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/hbz/lobid.git
   ```
   
   Go to `gatsby/lobid` in the repo:
   
   ```shell
   cd lobid/gatsby/lobid
   ```
   
   Start it up.

   ```shell
   npm run develop
   ```

 *Open the source code and start editing!*

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   *Note*: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
   Also, only the dynamically generated pages (this defined in _src/pages_) are served properly with `gatsby develop`.

   Open the `lobid` directory in your code editor of choice and edit e.g. `src/pages/team-de.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

2. **Stage**

   The following assumes being in the web home on emphytos: `ssh <user>@emphytos`; `sudo su - lobid`; `cd /srv/www/htdocs/`.

   We separate stage and production, so first go to the staging section:
   ```shell
   cd stage.lobid.org/gatsby/lobid
   ```
   
   It's always good to clean up first:
   ```shell
   npm run clean
   ```
   Let's build:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

   This generates the `public` folder which is the `document root` of apache.

   Test the build by visiting http://stage.lobid.org/. Other than by `gatsby develop` now also the static files can be viewed.

3. **Deploy**

   If all is well, go to the production location (lobid.org/gatsby/lobid), pull with `no-ff` as always and repeat the `build` process above.

   *Note*: 
   If you deploy, the public folder is deleted and so there is a downtime of the pages. It takes around half a minute.

   Other pages, like `/download`, `/labs` etc. are configured to another document root, see the `vhost.conf` on emphytos for that.
   
   Test the deployment by visiting http://lobid.org/.

## üßê What's inside

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1. **`/node_modules`**: contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages). If it doesn't exist, you haven't installed _gatsby_ yet.

2. **`/src`**: contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3. **`static**: contains files that will not be processed by gatsby directly but rather copied directly to `public`, e.g. images, css, some json and html files.

4. **`public**: the root directory: these files are served from apache. They are generated by gatsby and are the "static sites generated".

5. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, configure the _prefix-paths_ etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6. **`gatsby-node.js`** Used to configure routes. The route `/team` is configured to point to `./src/pages/team-de.js`. I.e. the former acts as the canonical path and serves the German team page.

7. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

8. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

9. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

### Note on `gatsby-transformer-json`

[This gatsby plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-json/) is used to parse JSON and make it accessible for GraphQL queries.
Some time ago they changed the behaviour of the `id` attribute and automatically transform it to `jsonId` (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-json/).
This is a bit painful when you are working with Linked Data.
So make sure to be aware of it, if anything with `.id` does not work they way you expect.
Maybe you need `jsonId`.

<h2> Example: changing data on the `team` page </h2>
  
  Open the file `static/team.json` and update the data there (this is our *Model*).
  If you only had to change the data, do `gatsby build` in the `gatsby/lobid/` directory and the `/team-de/` and `team-en` pages are updated. You are done!
  
  If you want to add or remove data, you have to change and graphql your *Model* (your `static/team.json`) via the *Controller** (`src/pages/team-de.js` and `src/pages/team-en.js` - which pass the data to `src/components/team.html.js`, aka *View*). The latter is the template for generating both language pages. Here you work on html and JSX Javascript. At the end, don't forget to `gatsby build`!
